        <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Dear Eileen, </p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of 
            Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. 
            I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
             however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;
              the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates </a>on our website.</p>
        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
        <p>At the Awsome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - 
            as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intellegent, 
            dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you submitted
        we were msot intrigued by are as follwos, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turnig H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect ofn preformance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&#8451;(86&#8457;), 
                when the audience size exponetially increase (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup>&gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please you provide more information on each of these subjects, includeing how long you'd expect the research to take, 
            required staff and other reasons, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance. To answer you question, 
            my favourite dances are as follows, with defnitions: 
        </p>
           <dl>
               <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
               <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<u>BC</u>, a whole village would dance around
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
               <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
               <dd>Before the Icelanders developted fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, 
                   which involved hudding close together in a circle oon the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny,
                   very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interresting examole of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", 
                    stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northem Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they are just moving like this because they were really cold.
                </dd>

           <p>Yours siencerely</p>
